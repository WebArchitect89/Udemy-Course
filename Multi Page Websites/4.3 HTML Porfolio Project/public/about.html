<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  I am a web designer at the beginning of my career. A Complete rookie in the
  field, the reason I am participating in the bootcamp is that I am very
  passionate about web developing and what it does to make the web world around
  us so fascinating. Although I am not too experienced in the field at the
  moment I am confident that I would become a great web developer.
